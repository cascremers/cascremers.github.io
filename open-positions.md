# Multiple open PhD and Postdoc positions in security and formal analysis

Professor [Cas Cremers](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/cas.cremers/intro.html) is expanding his research group within the recently founded CISPA-Helmholtz center in Saarbruecken, Germany, and has several open PhD and Postdoc positions. Please get in touch if you are interested!

## Our research

Our research focuses around security analysis and communication systems, for which we provide mathematical foundations, analysis tools, and novel security mechanisms.  For example, our research has contributed to the analysis of the TLS 1.3 and Signal protocols, and co-developed the Scyther tool and the Tamarin prover.

Our methodology typically ranges from theoretical work (formal methods, term rewriting, process calculi, game-hopping proofs, computational and symbolic approaches) to algorithms for analysis tools (e.g., interactive theorem proving, constraint solving), to the development of new protocols (e.g., for the automatic detection of misuse of secrets, or strongly secure group messaging).

For some examples of our work, see:

- [Tamarin theory paper](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/cas.cremers/downloads/papers/dh_tamarin_extended_v1.pdf)
- [TLS 1.3 protocol analysis paper](https://tls13tamarin.github.io/TLS13Tamarin/docs/tls13tamarin-draft21.pdf)
- [Signal protocol analysis paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf)
- [ART protocol design paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/666.pdf)

## Candidates

We are looking for excellent students and PhDs. We are particularly interested in attracting a broad range of candidates, and are committed to diversity and inclusion. We also enjoy our work, and feel that the working place should be enjoyable for everyone, and allow for flexible working hours — ask our alumni and current students for references.

The research group will be situated in Saarbruecken, Germany within the [CISPA-Helmholtz center](https://cispa.saarland/). Positions are paid according to the relevant German pay scales. 

## Requirements

For a PhD position, we require a Master’s degree in a relevant topic at the time of starting.
Similarly, for a post-doctoral researcher position, we require a relevant PhD degree at the time of starting. However, we encourage candidates to apply early, e.g., when anticipating a finishing date.

Evidence of knowledge in the following backgrounds would be beneficial:

- Formal methods
- Logics
- Theorem proving
- Cryptography

If you have a research idea or proposal already than that is great, but we are also happy to work with good candidates to find a topic that works for all. We have many exciting ongoing research projects.
